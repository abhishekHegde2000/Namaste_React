# Namaste_React
 This repository contains my journey of learning React. I will be posting my code here as I learn new things, and I will also be building projects to practice my skills.  I am a beginner, so please be patient with me. I am learning as I go, and I am always looking for feedback and suggestions.  If you are also learning React, feel free to contribute to this repository. I would love to see your code and learn from you.  Thank you for visiting!  You can also add some specific details about your learning goals and what kind of projects you plan to build in the repository. For example, you could say something like:  I am learning React to build web applications. I am particularly interested in building single-page applications (SPAs) with React.  I plan to build a few simple SPAs to start with, and then I will move on to more complex projects. I am also interested in learning about React Native, so I may eventually build some mobile applications as well.  I am excited to learn React and build amazing things with it!  I hope this helps!
